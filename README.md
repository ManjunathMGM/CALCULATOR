# Description
A program for calculator in C. <br />
This is a very simple calculator which can perform six different operations. <br />

> **I want to develop a fully functional complex calculator which can perform different operations between any desired number of inputs.**
_LANGUAGE USED - C_

So it would be a great help if someone help me in developing this project and debug if there are any errors. <br />
_You can ignore the symbols I used in the comments of above file as they are based on the extensions I use in VS CODE._
