# Description
A program for calculator in C. <br />
This is a very simple calculator which can perform six different operations between any 2 numbers. <br />

> I want to develop a fully functional complex calculator which can perform different operations between desired number of inputs.


So it would be a great help if someone help me in developing this project.
